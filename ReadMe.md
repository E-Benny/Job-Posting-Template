## Job Posting Template
This project was developed using both HTML and CSS to develop a concept for a job positing.

## Installation
This file does not need NPM or Yarn to run. Simply open the HTML file in the web browser. 

## Project Status
The project runs fine. I didn't use any JavaScript code so there was no need to test for any function.
